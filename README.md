# Natours 
This is a project from the current NodeJS course that I'm taking, the **Node.js, Express, MongoDB & More: The Complete Bootcamp 2022** course.
Check out the instructor: @jonasschmedtmann 

## Objectives
1. Be building my own fast, scalable, and powerful Node.js RESTful APIs or web applications;

2. Truly understand how Node.js works behind the scenes;

3. Be able to work with NoSQL data and model data in real-world situations (a hugely important skill);

4. Know how modern back-end development works, and how all the different technologies fit together (hard to understand from scattered tutorials and videos);

5. Have experience in professionally-used tools and libraries like Express, Mongoose, Stripe, Sendgrid, Atlas, Compass, Git, Heroku, and many more;

6. Have built a complete application, which is a perfect starting point for your own applications in the future.

## Notes
- Each commit basically represents a lesson I have taken to finish this project.
- To run this project in your machine you should run: 
    1. **npm install**
    2. **npm run development**

- Some of the code may have a different approach from the one taken by the instructor.

## Enjoy The Ride!
